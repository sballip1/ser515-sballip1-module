We have designed 5 design patterns.
1. Facade
2. Bridge
3. Factory
4. Iterator
5. Visitor

Requirements: Configure JDK to run Main.java

1. Running Main.java will result will prompt for login
2. Facade pattern is used during login and userType is found during login.
3. User is prompted to select menuType - meat or produce and relevant menu is showed using bridge pattern.
4. User is then required to select one option among addTrade, viewTrade and viewAllHisTrades.
5. Factory pattern is used during the call createProductMenu on person differently for both Seller and Buyer.
6. Iterator pattern is used to iterate over offerring list and product list.
7. The reminder is supposed to be triggered by time but we've called it here at the end for demo purposes.
